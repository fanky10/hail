# hail

Hail is a command for publishing android builds to HockeyApp.
Because for playing hockey first you need some snow, right?

This is not intended for production Continuous Delivery (but it may work), it's just a home made script. If you are a devOp and know way better scripting than I do (of course you will), feel free to suggest / contribute.

## Getting started

For now it's just a simple script file intended to be run locally.

### Prerequisites

This script file depends on:
- [shyaml](https://github.com/0k/shyaml) for parsing config file
- [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) to prettify the curl upload response.

### Installing

- Clone the repo

- Add dependencies: 
```bash
$ brew install shyaml
$ brew install jq
```

- Configure config.yml with proper params and move to user defined configuration

```bash
$ mkdir ~/.config/hail/
$ cp config.yml ~/.config/hail/
```

- Add execution access: 

`$ chmod +x hail.sh`

- Add alias to user binaries

`$ ln -s /path/to/hail/hail.sh /usr/local/bin/hail`

### Configuration

Configuration is made through modifying config.yaml as follows:

```yaml
defaults:
    # build command options
    build:
        # root dir for android project
        root_dir: /path/to/project
        # gradle relative to root dir
        gradle_file: app/build.gradle
        # version name for hockey app
        app_version_name: 1.0.0
        # gradlew execution command
        assemble: "clean assembleDebug"
    # release command options
    release: 
        # 0 - Do not notify
        should_notify: 0
        # status:
        # 2 - mr worldwide
        available_for_download: 2
        # 0 - Textile, 1 - Markdown
        notes_type: 1
        # release notes plain text file
        release_notes_path: /path/to/release_notes.txt
        # found in https://rink.hockeyapp.net/manage/auth_tokens
        user_app_token: 
        # app id from hockey app
        app_id: hockeyAppId
        # apk binary build path
        apk_path: /path/to/app.apk
# specific build type can be added here
# which overrides defaults values
release_build_type:
    build:
        assemble: assembleRelease
    release:
        app_id: releaseHockeyAppId
        apk_path: /path/to/app-release.apk     
```

### Running
`$ hail -v -b -r -f release_build_type -c /path/to/config.yaml`

Where:
- v: verbose
- b: execute build
- r: execute release
- f: build type name (optional)
- c: yaml config file (optional)

## Contributing

Create an issue as you see fit, I will work on them or reject them depending on the importance of the feature or bug.
I have some ideas on my own tracked as [issues](https://github.com/fanky10/hail/issues)

The process for submitting pull requests is really simple, add issue number and description, submit the PR, I will review, add comments and merge.

## Versioning

I use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. There is no version available at the moment but when I feel confortable enough with 1.0.0 I will add it. Find [tags on this repository](https://github.com/fanky10/hail/tags).
